Custom_Component esphome for homeassistant with climate preset

This allow to use new aioesphomeapi support for climate presets until it's not officially supported.
It needs other repo to work: my fork of aioesphomeapi and my fork of esphome (midea-climate-support) branch

To use it copy the esphome folder under custom_components in home assistant
